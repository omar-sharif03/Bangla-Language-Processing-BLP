## Abstract
Recently, determining the customer impression is
considered one of the prominent factors on the success of the
restaurant businesses. Due to the rapid growth of digital contents
related to restaurant or foods in the web, people are more inclined
on reviews before going to any restaurant so the significance of
customer review is inevitable. In order to selects a restaurant
customer needs to check thousands of feedback’s to understand
the restaurant quality or services. Therefore, classification of
a significant amount of reviews into a sentimental category is
required to attain meaningful insights so that the customer can
choose restaurants based on their preferences. This classification
can be done by sentiment analysis. This paper proposes a system
that can classify customer reviews into positive and negative
classes based on their sentimental feedback. We have tested the
proposed system with 1000 restaurant reviews text written in
Bengali. The experimental result shows that the proposed the
system can classify restaurant reviews with 80:48% accuracy
using multinomial Na¨ıve Bayes.
