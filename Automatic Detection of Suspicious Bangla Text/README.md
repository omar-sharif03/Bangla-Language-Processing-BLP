## Abstract
Suspicious Bangla text detection is a text classification problem
of determining Bangla texts into suspicious and non suspicious categories.
In this paper, we have proposed a machine learning based system
that can classify Bangla texts into suspicious and non-suspicious. For this
purpose, a corpus is developed and logistic regression algorithm is used
for classification task. In order to measure the effectiveness of the proposed
system a comparison of accuracy among other algorithms such as
Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, and decision tree also performed. The experimental
result with 1500 training documents and 500 testing documents
shows that the logistic regression provides the highest accuracy (92%)
than other algorithms.
