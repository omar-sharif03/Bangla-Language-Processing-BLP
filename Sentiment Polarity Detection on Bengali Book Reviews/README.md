## Abstract
Recently, sentiment polarity detection has increased attention
to NLP researchers due to the massive availability of customer’s
opinions or reviews in the online platform. Due to the continued expansion
of e-commerce sites, the rate of purchase of various products,
including books, are growing enormously among the people. Reader’s
opinions/reviews affect the buying decision of a customer in most cases.
This work introduces a machine learning-based technique to determine
sentiment polarities (either positive or negative category) from Bengali
book reviews. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a
corpus with 2000 reviews on Bengali books is developed. A comparative
analysis with various approaches (such as logistic regression, naive
Bayes, SVM, and SGD) also performed by taking into consideration of
the unigram, bigram, and trigram features, respectively. Experimental
result reveals that the multinomial Naive Bayes with unigram feature
outperforms the other techniques with 84% accuracy on the test set.
