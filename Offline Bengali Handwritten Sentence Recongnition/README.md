## Abstract
It is a very challenging task to recognize unconstrained Bengali
handwritten text due to its cursive nature. This paper introduces an
offline technique of recognizing handwritten Bengali sentences based on
BiLSTM architecture and connectionist temporal classification (CTC)
output layer. The traditional approach of detecting handwritten sentence
recognition rises the computational complexity due to the difficulty
of combining isolated characters. The proposed method only segments
the sentences into words, recognizes separately and combines them to
represents the output sentence. The proposed technique is evaluated
with 450 Bengali sentences and achieved 92% accuracy for recognizing
sentences considering 15 distinct writing styles.
